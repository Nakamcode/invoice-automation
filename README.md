# Invoice Automation

A full-stack invoice management system with a FastAPI backend and React frontend.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- Node.js 18+
- npm

---

## Setup

### Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate       # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate [*]
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Copy the example env file (Ethereal SMTP is pre-configured for local email testing):

```bash
cd backend/.env.example backend/.env
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

---

## Dev

Run both servers concurrently in separate terminals.

**Backend** (from `backend/`, with venv active):

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

API is available at `http://localhost:8000`. Interactive docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

**Frontend** (from `frontend/`):

```bash
npm run dev
```

App is available at `http://localhost:5173`. API requests are proxied to the backend automatically.

---

## Test

### Backend unit tests

```bash
cd backend
source .venv/bin/activate
pytest
```

### Frontend end-to-end tests (Playwright)

Requires both the backend and frontend dev servers to be running first.

```bash
cd frontend
npx playwright install --with-deps   # first time only
npm run test:e2e
```

Run with a UI:

```bash
npm run test:e2e:ui
```

---

## Email (Ethereal)

The app is pre-configured to send emails via [Ethereal](https://ethereal.email) — a fake SMTP service for development. Emails are never actually delivered; you read them in the Ethereal web inbox instead.

1. Go to **https://ethereal.email/login**
2. Log in with the credentials from `backend/.env`:
   - **Email:** `adan.block36@ethereal.email`
   - **Password:** `VfjFUWShGJu1TxFF8n`
3. Click **Messages** to see all captured emails (invoice reminders, etc.)

---

## Build

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm run build
```

Output is in `frontend/dist/`.

### Docker

Build and run each service with Docker:

```bash
# Backend
docker build -t invoice-backend ./backend
docker run -p 8000:8000 -v $(pwd)/data:/app/data invoice-backend

# Frontend
docker build -t invoice-frontend ./frontend
docker run -p 80:80 invoice-frontend
```
